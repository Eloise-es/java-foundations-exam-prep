# Classes and COnstructors

- create a new class including main
- use private modifier
- describe relationship between object and its members
- difference between class variable, instance variable, local variable
- create object's default constructor which modifies the object's fields
- use constructors with and without parameters
- develop code that overloads constructors

## Relationship between object and its members

To access an object and its instance variables, we have to save a reference to the object.

### `this` keyword

We use it to mean the object/instance that we are currently inside. Sometimes it's not necessary, but we should still use it for better readability.

> Note: watch out for redundant assignment in the exam!

This:

- it's a keyword
- the type is the class in which it is used
- it works just like any other local variable
- you can't modify it
- it can only be used in the context of a class

## Access modifiers
